       <br> <p class="y">Whether it’s because of a game-winning goal or a crucial save, the players usually draw most of the attention. However, there wouldn’t be a successful team or a decorated player without the right manager. Head coaches are just as important in soccer as a goalkeeper, a midfielder or a striker. Without them, the sport simply wouldn’t be the same.</p>
